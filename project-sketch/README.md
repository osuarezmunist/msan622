Planned Tools
------------------------------
I will be sticking to the basics, R, ggplot2 and shiny, as my focus will be in providing simple visualizations of complex analysis with interactivity.

Planned Techniques
------------------------------
Given a relatively long questionnaire of 40-50 items, the program will be performing correlational analysis, factor analysis and linear modeling.

Planned Interaction
------------------------------
Questions will be user-selected for the different types of analysis. To facilitate the selection, sorting and filtering will be implemented. The idea is that by examining descriptives and correlations, interesting questions can be selected for further analysis. Different tabbed panels will allow for variable selecting, grouping into indexes and linear modeling of selected dependent variables. Given one or more DV's, I want to automate the process of testing multiple models and represent them graphically for comparison.

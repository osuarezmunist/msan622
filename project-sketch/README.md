Planned Tools
I will be sticking to the basics, R, ggplot2 and shiny, as my focus will be in providing simple visualizations of complex analysis with interactivity

Planned Techniques
Given a relatively long questionnaire of 40-50 items, the program will be performing correlational analysis, factor analysis and linear modeling.

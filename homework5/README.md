The Seatbelts data sets presents several challenges, as it is a time series with a clear seasonal cycle. Additionally, it there are a number of measured changes of the time period, including the enactemetn of a seatbelt law in 1983 and changes in miles driven over time. Since the data set only goes until 1984, the seatbelt law is only in effect for 2 of the 16 years if data. Furthermore, there are many known changes to cars and driving habits not incldued in the data set. 

Also, multiple accident variables are reported, inlcuding deaths and injuries. I chose to look at deaths, as these seem to be the outcome that would not change over time.

To show the impact of the seatbelt law on driver deaths, I plotted three graphs:

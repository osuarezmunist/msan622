## Instructions ##

Each R files contains all code necessary to generate the corresponding plot. First, make sure you downlaoded the directories, DQen and DQenC. All files should be in the same workign directory.

## Discussion ##

I chose a book, Don Quixote of La Mancha by Cervantes as my corpus. The text is available in multiple languages and formats. I chose to work with the single file format for the first two visualizations, but use the chapter files for the third.

The first visualization is a simple bar chart of the top appearing words, aftere stop word removal and stemming. Interesting to see the types of words that appear, besides the proper names of the main characters.

I chose a book, Don Quixote of La Mancha by Cervantes as my corpus. The text is available in multiple languages and formats. I chose to work with the single file format for the first two visualizations, but use the chapter files for the third.

The first visualization is a simple bar chart of the top appearing words, aftere stop word removal and stemming. Interesting to see the types of words that appear, besides the proper names of the main characters. I made the image wide so the words could be read easily wihtout rotation. I kept the height proportional to avoid distortion.

## Introduction ##
The purpose of this prototype was to explore the benefits of using visualizations to quickly assess the potential value of a survey of students. I regularly have to analyze results of questionnaires administered by third parties with no previous knwoledge or information about the origin of the questions or the purpose of the survey. In additon to basic descriptives, I am trying to (1) eliminate uninteresting or mal-functioning questions, (2) group questions into dimensions and/or indexes and (3) select dependent and independent variables for regressions. This requires an iterative process to select variables of interest and group into associated sets. I am exploring the use of visualizations to (1) more efficiently make the first "cuts" of the variables and (2) reduce the number and length of interations to the final selection and groping of the variables of interest. I envision this being a useful tool for me and my colleagues doing similar work.


### Data Set ###
I selected a typical data set of around 800 reponses to a pre-course survey of a college chemistry course. Variable types were limited to categorical and discrete ordinal, mostly 5-point Likert scale. The homogeneity of the ordinal variables reduces the rescaling and recoding significnatly. The questions can be seen the DataDictionaryR.csv file. There are a total of 50 questions. I could not include the response codes, just the

## Discussion ##

Developed plots as a question to solve: What state had the highest life expectancy in 1977? 
Provided Interactive scatter plot with 3 zoom levels as well as selection of variable to compare to life expectancy. But I hid state-level information as needed to not give the answer away.

Small Multiples have 2 levels of zoom and variable selection.
Parallel Coordinates and Heatmap only have 2 levels of zoom, as all variables are shown.

All plots are linked; changes in one are reflected in all others.
